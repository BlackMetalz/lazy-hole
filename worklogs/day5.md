## Story 5.2: Single host restore

Goal: Remove all effects of specific host

Nothing hard, because hardest part was yesterday. Restore simply mean remove all effect tracked in host, we call function to remove rule, we delete it in map that tracked in memory.

Hmm, i think it still miss feature that we will lost track if we close program.

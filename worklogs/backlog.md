# Duplicate feature
I realized that blackhole or iptables drop/reject is act the same way. It is all handled in Layer 3. So I think we can remove iptables action.

# TODO: Missing feature persist effects
It can be persist effects to file. Not decided yet. Maybe v3 xDD

# TODO: Add fuzzy search for select host

Make them work like search in K9S

# Make host list order is persistent, follow order in config!
